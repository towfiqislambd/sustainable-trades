# Project Name : Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform (Sustainable Trades)

## 1. Description:

**Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform** is a fully dynamic, production-ready, and SEO-friendly marketplace built with Next.js v15, TypeScript, and a modern tech stack.

It’s designed for real-world e-commerce operations, supporting five user roles — Admin, Basic Vendor, Pro Vendor, Customer, and Guest — each with their own tailored dashboards and permissions.

The platform enables multiple vendors to manage their shops, products, trades, and subscriptions, while customers can explore nearby shops, chat in real time, follow stores, and purchase products seamlessly.

Developed using the latest Next.js features, TypeScript for type safety, and TanStack Query for optimized data fetching, this application ensures performance, maintainability, and scalability across all devices.
